# <center> Aligning research with policy and practice for sustainable agriculturial land systems in Europe

## Abstract:

__background:__
three factors support the sustainable development, include

- research

- policy

- practice

__method:__

chosed 239 foctors of agricultural systems,include

- environmental factors

- social factors

- management choices

- outcomes

使用了239个因子，包括：环境,社会,农业产出，和管理措施。

69 research articles，SDGs and four EU policies, and seven agricultural sustainability assessment tools aimed at famers was selected to get data parameters. 
这些因子选取自69篇文章和7种农场主使用的可持续性评价工具，还有一些政策报告和可持续发展目标。

__result:__

this study recognize ___32 variables___ as key to agriculture system under three perspectives.
<bra>研究表明有 __32__ 种因子在三种视角下对农业都至关重要

the other 207 variables appear in only or two perspectives, we may overlook if evaluated from only one perspective.
<bra>过去的报道只从1个或者2给个角度研究的207因素可能高估其对可持续农业的影响。

this study identified ___4 approaches___ to agriculture and systems research in Europe that omit most of the variables considered important from policy and practice perspectives.
<bra>本研究甄别出4种农业系统的研究方法，但这写方法都忽略了从政策或者事件角度进行研究的重要性。

__conclusion:__

We posit that the four approaches reflect prevailing paradigms of research design and data analysis and suggest future research design should consider including the 32 shared variables as a starting point for more policy- and practicerelevant research.
<bra>这个研究认为通常所用的4个研究范式应该更多关注政策和实践。

 Our identification of shared priorities from different perspectives and attention to environmental and social domains and the functional role of system components provide a concrete basis to encourage codesigned and systems-based research approaches to guide agriculture’s contribution to the SDGs. 
<bra>本研究甄别出的32个因子为综合设计研究方法提供了坚实的基础
